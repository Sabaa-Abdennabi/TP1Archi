The SOLID principles are design principles that are used in Object-Oriented software development in order to encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible applications. 
In this Repo, we  iterate through each principle where a given problem has already been addressed. 
We provide a solution in exercice_refactored folder to each problem .
